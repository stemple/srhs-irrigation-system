# srhs-irrigation-system
This is the project for setting up an automated irrigation system in the San Rafael High School garden.

The project includes the Arduino code for running the automated timer. This requires an internet connection to connect to a network time server.

The hardware includes an Arduino Mega with WiFi shield, an LCD and mosfet transistors for controlling solenoid valves.

Much of this code was copied from other sources and then modified and improved by students at SRHS.
